settable max PWM/RPM for Fans (ignore when > max temp)
settable min PWM/RPM for Fans (maybe... mostly useful to prevent overheating during init)
sensors combinable (i.e. Case Fan via max(cpu.sensor,gpu.sensor) or median)

api / socket / whatever for:
  - stats db
  - current readouts
  - currently loaded config

when initializing, eject and go full throttle if one configured sensor overheats

graphical interface for config and monitoring
